Add [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) documentation to your Feathers services and optionally show them in the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

You can also add custom methods to feathers services that will be available as rest routes but not via the feathers client.

Checkout the [Documentation](https://feathersjs-ecosystem.github.io/feathers-swagger) for further information.
